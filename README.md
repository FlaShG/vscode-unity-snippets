# VS Code Unity Snippets
This extension for Visual Studio Code provides code snippets for working with Unity
C# scripts. It contains the "Message" functions within MonoBehaviour, such as "Start",
"OnCollisionEnter", and "OnSerializeNetworkView", complete with their signatures and
brief documentation.

The "modification" is the removal of the summary blocks that were attached to
all snippets in the original package created by Ycleptic Studios. They were
ugly and a source of complaints on the original mod's extension page, so I
removed them.

## Usage
To use the snippets, simply begin typing one of the functions and the suggestions will
appear within the IntelliSense popup. Press enter or tab to insert the snippet.

## Installation
1. Open the VS Code command palette `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd`-`Shift`-`P` (OSX).
2. Type `ext install unity-snippets-modified`.
